### 7TV_scrape


#### ! Currently works with old 7TV.app. Need to wait for new finished 7TV.app website. !

CLI tool that prints out emotes from [7TV.app](https://7tv.app/) with users input.

Copies emote's link to users clipboard by giving it's index as answer to the query.

```
./scrape_7TV emotename
```
